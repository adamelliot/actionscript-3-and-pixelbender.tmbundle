You'll want to disable the current ActionScript bundles as this one doesn't
play super well with them.

To get the bundle properly working you'll need to have downloaded the flex
SDK. It should work with either version 3 or 4. You'll need to have them on
your path as flex. Keep in mind that version 3 will compile files for Flash 9 and version 4 will compile for Flash 10.

For example I have a ~/bin folder in my home folder on my path. Inside I have
the flex sdk downloaded as flex: ~/bin/flex/

For the debugger to properly log to the window you'll need to have the debug
player (for the browser):

The current version works fairly well. It shows traces and the like in the
player window, but it can be flakey at times. Let me know if you have any
issues and I can try to work them out.

To setup a project create a file called project.yml in the base directory of
of your project.

The only thing you really need in here is this line:
application-class: App

Where App is the name of your base class for your project.

To specify command line options to mxmlc use the compile-options parameter EG:
compile-options:
  output: something_cool.swf
  
The compiler will respect your inline AS directive like:
[SWF(...)], etc

To run Pixel Bender files you'll need to download the Pixel Bender toolkit. When you run the file it will open in Pixel Bender.
